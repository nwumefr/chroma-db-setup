At Ronald McDonald Family Camp, we know that the childhood
cancer journey doesn’t end when treatment does. Families still need
time to heal, reconnect, and simply enjoy being together. After a
successful pilot year in 2024, where families shared how meaningful

it was “not to be forgotten” at this stage in their journey, we are
excited to expand this program in 2025! This special, expenses-paid
retreat is designed for families who have a child who is 1-5 years off
of cancer treatment, offering a long weekend of laughter, relaxation,
and community in the beautiful Pocono Mountains.
What to Expect
Imagine a weekend where your family can just be a family—playing,
relaxing, and making new memories together. We offer a balance of
adventure and downtime, with activities like watersports, archery,
and arts & crafts, as well as peaceful lakeside moments and cozy
campfires. Families will also have opportunities to join child and adult
group activities, share experiences, and form meaningful
connections with others who truly understand the journey.
A team of social workers from the Ronald McDonald House will be
present to support caregivers in ways that feel natural and
comfortable. While the weekend is not a therapy program, some
activities—such as guided art projects—can offer a creative way to
process emotions and express thoughts and feelings that are hard to
put into words, while others, like movement, drumming, and nature
walks, provide opportunities to relax, reset, and find a sense of
balance. The goal is to reduce stress and foster gratitude in a way
that feels personal and approachable.
We keep the weekend tech-free so that families can unplug and
focus on what matters most—each other. With just 10-15 families
attending, the atmosphere is intimate, supportive, and full of
warmth.
Who is Eligible?
Families with a child who is 1-5 years off cancer treatment.

What Families Say About the Weekend
“It allowed us an opportunity to come together and connect free of
devices, distractions, and the ordinary burdens of life. After all these
kids and families have been through – years of hospital stays,
medicine, fear, and anxiety about the future – it was great to be able to
just spend time in a beautiful and supportive environment having fun,
sharing our experiences, and showing gratitude.” — Parent
“[The weekend] provided such joyful memories for us – we frequently
talk about our wonderful bonding weekend. It also provided quality
time with other adults that understand our journey – our daughter may
look healthy, but our journey is still going on and they understand while
many others don’t.” — Parent
“[Family Camp] allowed the kids to develop more confidence by
trying activities they have never done before. It allowed us to build
lifelong memories. And it also allowed us to reflect, cry and laugh in a
way that only other RMH families would understand.” — Parent
