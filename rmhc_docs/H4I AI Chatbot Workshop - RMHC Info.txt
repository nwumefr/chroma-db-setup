* Every Ronald McDonald House is a haven for families with children in the hospital. It provides all the comforts of home, plus the compassion of staff, volunteers, and other families — all just steps away from the hospital.
* When the best medical treatment for a child is far from home, families don’t have to worry about where to stay. At a Ronald McDonald House, families can be together, enjoy home-cooked meals and receive compassionate hospitality and support from staff and volunteers — all near the child’s hospital.
* A Ronald McDonald House program helps reduce stress and financial burden for families when they must travel far from home to access medical care for their child.
* "Through it all, the Ronald McDonald House helped keep our whole family balanced." - words of a mom, Liz Herrick.
* Houses are built on the simple idea that nothing else should matter when a family is focused on the health of their child. Providing spaces for families to stay together, grow stronger and all be part of the solution for the sick child is what we are all about.
* In 2024 alone, Ronald McDonald House provided over 2.8 million overnight stays, helping families save $678 million in lodging and meal expenses.
* RMHC believes the diverse backgrounds, cultures and experiences of our global organization are essential to delivering compassionate care and support to families when they need it most. Our strength lies in our diversity, and we are united by a shared commitment to inclusion and belonging. We remain unwavering in our dedication to this core value.

   * Houses typically include bedrooms, kitchens, dining areas, common spaces, play rooms, and support services — all designed to ease the stress of long hospital stays.
   * Each House is owned and operated by a local Ronald McDonald House Chapter. The Chapter is governed by a local Board of Directors who are responsible for program development and operations.
   * How to stay at a Ronald McDonald House: Contact the social service department at the hospital where your child will receive treatment. They will place your name on the waiting list for the day that you intend to arrive. Because each child's treatment is unique, a family’s stay at the House is unpredictable. Therefore, most local Ronald McDonald House Chapters are unable to confirm room reservations for your stay prior to your arrival.
   * In general, Ronald McDonald House programs offer rooms for families of pediatric patients 21 years old and younger. Due to the demand for rooms, some Houses accommodate families of patients up to 18 only. For most Houses, families may stay as long as their child remains in active treatment, although some Houses may establish a maximum length of stay at a Ronald McDonald House programs in order to accommodate room demand. This is determined on a local basis.
   * The costs of staying at a Ronald McDonald House: The actual cost to operate a room varies between $50 and $100 a night. Families either stay at no cost or are asked to make a donation up to $25 per day, depending on the house. However, payment is NEVER expected for those who cannot afford it. The difference is made up through donations. Thanks to your contributions, it is a global Ronald McDonald House policy that a family never be turned away because of their ability to pay.
   * Who can stay at a Ronald McDonald House: The families of children, from birth through 21 years of age (or 18, depending on the House), who are being treated at nearby hospitals and medical facilities, are eligible. The patient is also eligible to stay with the family if he/she is being treated on an outpatient basis. Please contact the Ronald McDonald House programs in your community to find out if there are other policies or requirements.
   * How long can families stay at Ronald McDonald Houses: Stays can be as short as one night or as long as several months, and sometimes extend to a year or more, depending on the child's illness and treatment.
* Ronald McDonald Family Room: Calm, private lounge spaces inside hospitals.
   * A Ronald McDonald House Family Room is a quiet place away from the medical space, for families to recharge, grab a bite to eat, shower, or get rest during the long days of testing or treatment.
   * For families with children in the hospital, days can feel never-ending. In a Ronald McDonald House Family Room, family members can get some rest, meet other families, do some laundry or just recharge to remain strong for their child.
