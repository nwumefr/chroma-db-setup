PHILADELPHIA FOR PEDIATRIC CARE. RMH'S THREE RONALD MCDONALD FAMILY
ROOMS EXTEND THE SUPPORT OF ITS HOUSES INTO THE HOSPITAL SETTING AND
OFFER A QUIET RESPITE SPACE FOR FAMILIES AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF
PHILADELPHIA AND ST. CHRISTOPHER'S HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN. RONALD
MCDONALD CAMP IS A WEEK-LONG OVERNIGHT CAMP FOR CHILDREN WITH CANCER

THE HOUSES OFFER FAMILIES A COMFORTABLE AND SECURE ROOM, DAILY
HOME-COOKED MEALS, A 24-HOUR FOOD PANTRY, COMPLIMENTARY TRANSPORTATION
AROUND THE CITY, FREE PARKING, AND LAUNDRY FACILITIES
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

ALL JUST MINUTES

THE HOUSES ALSO OFFER TV LOUNGES, INDOOR AND

OUTDOOR PLAY SPACES, EXERCISE ROOMS, FAMILY ACTIVITIES, LOANER LAPTOP
COMPUTERS AND WIFI, AND SOCIAL WORKER ASSISTANCE.

ADDITIONALLY, THE

HOUSES OFFER THE SUPPORT OF OTHER FAMILIES WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS
LIKE TO HAVE A SERIOUSLY ILL CHILD.

WHILE IT COSTS RMHC-PHI MORE THAN

$160 PER NIGHT TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES, FAMILIES ARE ASKED TO PAY $25
PER NIGHT.

HOWEVER, MANY OF THE FAMILIES ARE SO FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED

BY THEIR CHILD'S ILLNESS (AS A RESULT OF TREATMENT COSTS, JOB LOSS OR
LEAVE, TRAVELING, AND PAYING EXPENSES AT HOME) THAT THEIR FEE IS WAIVED
OR REDUCED; NO ONE IS EVER TURNED AWAY DUE TO INABILITY TO PAY.

FAMILIES TRAVELING FROM 25 MILES AWAY OR FURTHER FOR MEDICAL CARE AT
PHILADELPHIA HOSPITALS ARE ELIGIBLE TO STAY AT THE HOUSES, AND CHILDREN
MUST BE UNDER THE AGE OF 21 AND IN ACTIVE TREATMENT.

IN 2023,

RMHC-PHI'S TWO HOUSES COMBINED HAD 1,930 FAMILY STAYS WITH FAMILIES
TRAVELING FROM 48 STATES, 43 COUNTRIES AND 2 U.S. TERRITORIES; 34.3% OF
FAMILIES TRAVELED FROM WITHIN PENNSYLVANIA.

THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY

WAS 15 DAYS, WITH THE LONGEST LENGTH OF STAY FOR ONE FAMILY TOTALING
365 CONSECUTIVE DAYS DURING 2023.

WHILE RMHC-PHI SERVES FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN ARE BEING TREATED FOR AN
ARRAY OF ILLNESSES, THE TOP DEPARTMENTS IN 2023 WERE ORTHOPEDICS,
ONCOLOGY, NEONATOLOGY, CARDIOLOGY, AND NEUROLOGY.

RMHC-PHI STAFF AND

CAMP VOLUNTEERS HELD RMC VIRTUALLY ON THE ZOOM PLATFORM AND UTILIZED A

ACTIVITYIES AND EVENING ENTERTAINMENT.

EACH CAMPER RECEIVED A CAMPER

ACTIVITY PACKAGE PRIOR TO CAMP WHICH CONTAINED A CAMP T-SHIRT, SUPPLIES

CAMPER GROUPS PARTICIPATED DAILY IN SMALL

GROUP CABIN TIME, AGE-APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES, AND LEARNED ABOUT
