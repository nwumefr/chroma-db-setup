INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Board of Directors of
Ronald McDonald House Charities Philadelphia Region and Affiliates
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Ronald McDonald House Charities
Philadelphia Region and its affiliates PRMH, Inc. and PRMH Equipment, Inc., (collectively referred
to as RMHC-PHI), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of
December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses
and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RMHC-PHI as of December 31, 2023, and the changes in its
net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We
are required to be independent of RMHC-PHI and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the
preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether
there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about
RMHC-PHI’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the
consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial
likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.
In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:
•
•

•

•

•

exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those
risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of RMHC-PHI’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion
is expressed.
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about RMHC-PHI’s ability to continue as a going
concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other
matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal
control related matters that we identified during the audit.
Other Matter
Report on Summarized Comparative Information
We have previously audited RMHC-PHI’s 2022 consolidated financial statements, and we
expressed an unmodified audit opinion on those audited consolidated financial statements in our
report dated May 4, 2023. In our opinion, the summarized comparative information presented
herein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, is consistent, in all material respects,
with the audited consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House (RMH) was incorporated in Pennsylvania on May 8, 1974,
as a nonprofit organization for the purpose of supporting families of seriously ill children by creating
a community of comfort and hope. On January 1, 2019, RMH signed an agreement with Ronald
Mc Donald House Charities of the Philadelphia Region, Inc., a nonprofit organization who shared
the mission and is registered in Pennsylvania, to merge with RMH with RMH continuing as the
surviving organization with a new name Ronald McDonald House Charities Philadelphia Region.
The major sources of revenue are corporate and individual donors as well as events.
In April 2017, RMH formed a wholly controlled support corporation, PRMH, Inc., a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit corporation incorporated the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PRMH, Inc. was
established as part of a New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) financing transaction for the RMH
Expansion Project to act as a leverage lender, facilitating RMH’s ability to participate in the
NMTC program. PRMH, Inc. was created to raise funds for the support and benefit of, and to
carry out the purposes of, RMH which may include funds for capital expenditures, other financial
purposes, and to manage and invest such funds for the benefit of RMH. These activities are
funded primarily through grants and contributions.
In August 2020, RMH formed a wholly controlled support corporation, PRMH Equipment, Inc.,
a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation incorporated with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. PRMH
Equipment, Inc. was established as part of a New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) financing
transaction for the equipment portion of the RMH Expansion Project to act as a leverage lender,
facilitating RMH’s ability to participate in the NMTC program. PRMH Equipment, Inc. was
created to raise funds for the support and benefit of, and to carry out the purposes of, RMH
which may include funds for capital expenditures, other financial purposes, and to manage and
invest such funds for the benefit of RMH. These activities are funded primarily through grants
and contributions.
RMH, PRMH, Inc., PRMH Equipment, Inc., are collectively referred to as RMHC-PHI.
Programs
House Program
Two Ronald McDonald Houses, together serving up to 147 families each night, offer holistic
support and lodging to families traveling 25 miles or further to Philadelphia to receive medical
care for their seriously ill children. Founded as the first Ronald McDonald House in the world,
RMHC-PHI is the model for more than 375 Houses in 65 countries and regions around the globe
and has supported thousands of families in more than 45 years of operation.
Since opening, the flagship House – located at 3925 Chestnut Street – grew to 72,000 square
feet to accommodate a total of 45 families each night in 1995; in 2008, RMHC-PHI opened a
second 27,000-square-foot, three-story home with 20 bedrooms located at 100 E. Erie Avenue
to meet the expanding need for services throughout the City of Philadelphia. RMHC-PHI has
recently expanded the Chestnut Street location by 98,364 square feet with 82 additional
bedrooms to address the increasing demand for services. Construction of the new facility began
in the summer of 2017 and concluded in early 2020.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Programs (continued)
House Program (continued)
The Houses offer families a comfortable and secure room, daily home-cooked meals, a 24-hour
food pantry, complimentary transportation around the city, free parking, and laundry facilities –
all just minutes from the hospital. The Houses also offer TV lounges, indoor and outdoor play
spaces, exercise rooms, family activities, loaner laptop computers and Wi-Fi, and social worker
assistance. Additionally, the Houses offer the support of other families who understand what it
is like to have a seriously ill child. While it costs RMHC-PHI more than $160 per night to provide
these services, families are asked to pay $25 per night. However, many of the families are so
financially devastated by their child’s illness (as a result of treatment costs, job loss or leave,
traveling, and paying expenses at home) that their fee is waived or reduced; no one is ever
turned away due to inability to pay.
Families traveling from 25 miles away or further for medical care at Philadelphia hospitals are
eligible to stay at the Houses, and children must be under the age of 21 and in active treatment.
In 2023, RMHC-PHI’s two Houses combined had 1,930 family stays with families traveling from
48 states, 43 countries and 2 U.S. territories; 34.3% of families traveled from within
Pennsylvania. The average length of stay was 15 days, with the longest length of stay for one
family totaling 365 consecutive days during 2023.
While RMHC-PHI serves families whose children are being treated for an array of illnesses, the
top departments in 2023 were orthopedics, oncology, neonatology, cardiology, and neurology.
Each year, RMHC-PHI’s hospital partners include Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP),
St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, Shriners Hospital, Wills Eye Hospital, the Hospital of the
University of Pennsylvania and others.
Volunteers are truly the heart of the Houses and RMHC-PHI relies on the dedicated service of
more than 285 regularly scheduled volunteers to create a home for the families it serves.
Volunteers staff the front desk, drive the shuttle vans and support operations in a variety of other
capacities.
RMHC-PHI awarded grant funds to an external organization to produce a film entitled “Audrey’s
Children,” which is about the life of our organization’s visionary and co-founder, Dr. Audrey

around the opening of the Ronald McDonald House and costs associated with the Audrey Evans
actor. Grant monies were received by donors for film production and the amount awarded was
$1,670,876 and $73,244, for the year ended December 31 2022 and 2023, respectively, and is
included in grants and contributions on the statement of functional expenses within the House
program expenses.
Camp Program
Ronald McDonald Camp (RMC) enables children with cancer and their siblings to experience
the joys of summer camp. Created by RMH co-founder Dr. Audrey E. Evans in 1986, this oneweek camp was one of the very first of its kind to offer a camp experience specifically designed

for children with cancer and their siblings. RMC, held annually in the Pocono Mountains of
Pennsylvania, includes all of the activities found at a traditional overnight summer camp, such
as swimming, sailing, hiking, sports, arts and crafts, yoga, and rope courses, except that, at this
camp, campers can participate no matter what limitations they have. For many campers, the
week at camp is the first time they have ever tried the activities offered, and they go home not
only having discovered a new talent or learned a new skill, but having gained a sense of selfconfidence. For children who have felt isolated from their peers through their illness, and siblings
who have felt left out, camp is also an opportunity to join a family of campers who can relate to
one another, and to develop a wide-reaching support network that will last long after the week
of camp is over.
Children ages 7 to 17 (including current or former cancer patients and one sibling) are welcome
at camp and are divided by age into junior and senior camps. More than 100 fully-trained
volunteer counselors (many of whom are cancer survivors and past campers) and a full team of
over a dozen medical staff, including pediatric oncologists, nurses and social workers from
CHOP, volunteer their time over the summer to make camp possible.
In 2023, RMHC-PHI hosted two weeks of RMC for children with cancer and their siblings with
primary goals of keeping campers safe and providing an inclusive community of fun where
campers can experience engaging activities like any other kid.
A week of virtual camp was held in July for 22 campers whose medical conditions did not allow
for in person attendance. RMHC-PHI staff and camp volunteers held RMC virtually on the Zoom
platform and utilized a password protected portal for campers and families to access daily
activityies and evening entertainment. Each camper received a camper activity package prior
to camp which contained a camp t-shirt, supplies for activities throughout the week, an
instructions for accessing all online camp programming. Camper groups participated daily in
small group cabin time, age-appropriate activities, and learned about industries with behind-thescenes looks with professionals. In the evenings, campers and counselors logged on for all
camp activities with special guests, games, and the much-loved dance party.
In August, 136 campers and three participants in a Young Adult Leadership Program returned to
in person camp programming for a week at a campground in the Pocono Mountains. RMHC-PHI
coordinated with healthcare partners to ensure a safe return to in person activities which prioritized
immunocompromised camper health. Campers and counselors were required to be vaccinated,
comply with pre-camp testing, and the majority of activities were done outdoors. 122 volunteers
took part as counselors, activity specialists, and medical team members to make these weeks of
Camp possible. This summer, the Camp also received the highest marks on the accreditation
process through the American Camping Association, the standard camp excellence.

Camp Program (continued)
While there is no charge to the patient campers, siblings traditionally can attend for a nominal
fee of $150. In 2023, sibling fees totaled $6,050. Funding for the week is provided solely through
the contributions of individuals and organizations. Ronald McDonald Camp is accredited
through the American Camp Association (ACA) and is a member of the Children's Oncology
Camping Association, International (COCA). Ronald McDonald Camp, when held in-person, is
held at the Camp Timber Tops facility in Greeley, Pennsylvania.
Family Room Program
Three Ronald McDonald Family Rooms – two at CHOP and one at St. Christopher’s Hospital
for Children – extend the comfort and support of the Houses into the hospital by offering a quiet
place to rest and recharge away from the bedside for families whose children are receiving
treatment. The first Family Room at CHOP opened in the Oncology Unit in 2006. This Family
Room is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week including holidays; any patient and his/her
family in one of the combined total of 50 patient beds on the Oncology Unit may use the Family
Room. In March of 2017, RMHC-PHI opened a Family Room at St. Christopher’s Hospital for
Children to serve the Critical Care Tower. This Family Room serves up to 65 beds a night. In
2018, RMHC-PHI opened a second Family Room at CHOP’s Seashore House.
The Family Rooms offer a range of complimentary amenities and programming in a warm,
home-like environment. A central pillar of these services is the meal program which, thanks to
the generosity of donors, provides families with breakfast and dinner at scheduled times
throughout the week at the family-style dining tables located in the rooms. Snacks, coffee and
tea are also available to families through the program. Other amenities include comfortable
seating, kitchen facilities, televisions, DVD players (with an assortment of movies), books and
magazines. The Oncology Family Room also offers laundry facilities and a guest bathroom.
Programming in Family Rooms includes complimentary haircuts, yoga instruction, stress
management workshops, art therapy, crafts and a variety of other activities.
The Family Rooms serve families traveling from both near and far. Families coming from 25
miles away or farther and staying at Philadelphia Ronald McDonald House in the evening are
able to take a break in the rooms during the day, and families residing closer than 25 miles who
do not wish to leave their child’s side due to age or severity of illness can utilize the rooms as
much as needed.
The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile (RMCM)
The Ronald McDonald Care Mobile (RMCM) program provides access to pediatric medical,
dental and/or health education services for children living in underserved communities. The
RMCM program is breaking down the barriers to health care, expanding critical health care
access and extending the Charity’s reach to countless underserved children. The RMCM
program serves children that are at great risk to develop acute conditions, dental problems,

chronic diseases and even serious lifelong illnesses. Through partnerships with St.
Christopher’s Foundation for Children, RMHC-PHI is bringing critical dental services to underinsured or un-insured children right in their own neighborhood through onsite visits at schools,
head start programs and homeless shelters.
In 2023, the RMCM visited 47 unique site locations and provided dental education and care to
1673 children. The RMCM provided this vital care and education for a total of 219 days.
Basis of Accounting
RMHC-PHI prepares its consolidated financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting.
Consequently, revenue is recognized when earned and expenses are recorded when the
obligation is incurred.
Principles of Consolidation
RMH, PRMH, Inc. and PRMH Equipment, Inc. have been consolidated due to the presence of
effective control and economic interest, as required under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). All intra-entity balances and transactions
between RMH, PRMH, Inc. and PRMH Equipment, Inc. have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
RMHC-PHI classifies all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than 90 days
as cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and money market
funds. Restricted cash includes a loan reserve established for payment of the servicing fee in
compliance with the notes payable agreements.
Investments
Investments consist of mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and money market funds. These
investments are recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements at fair value.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability through
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Realized gains
or losses on sales of investments are recorded on the trade dates of the transactions.
Unrealized gains or losses on investments are determined by the change in fair value between
the beginning and end of the reporting period. All such gains and losses, interest, and dividends
are included in investment income in the consolidated statement of activities, net of investment
management fees.
Fair Value Measurement
Accounting standards define fair value and establish a framework for measuring fair value for
those assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. In accordance
with the fair value measurement standards, RMHC-PHI has categorized its applicable financial

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Fair Value Measurement (continued)
instruments into a required fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall
within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest-level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.
Applicable financial assets and liabilities are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation
techniques as follows:
Level 1 – Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted
prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that RMHC-PHI has the ability
to access.
Level 2 – Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in
markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 – Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation
techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall
fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumptions about
the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
As of December 31, 2023, only RMHC-PHI’s investments, as described in Note 3 of these
consolidated financial statements, were measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Pledges and Contributions Receivable
Pledges and contributions receivable consist of unconditional promises to give to RMHC-PHI.
Unconditional promises to give are recorded at their present net realizable value. For those due
in more than one year, fair value is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows at rates
approximating the current rate for risk-free returns. Management determines the allowance for
doubtful pledges by reviewing all outstanding pledges for possible uncollectibility. Pledges are
charged to the allowance account when deemed uncollectible.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis and consists of clothing,
aprons, backpacks, books, hats, pins and tote bags.
Property and Equipment and Related Depreciation
Land, buildings, building improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and construction in
progress are recorded at cost. Donated property is recorded at fair value at the date of donation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets: five to 35 years for the building and improvements and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures
and equipment. Construction in progress is not depreciated until the construction is completed
and the asset is placed in service. Expenditures for major repairs and improvements are

capitalized, while expenditures for minor repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when
incurred. RMHC-PHI capitalizes all fixed assets greater than $3,000 and an economic life in
excess of one year. Upon the retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any,
is included in revenue or expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of activities.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
RMHC-PHI reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the fair value
is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
There were no impairment losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Classification of Net Assets
The net assets of RMHC-PHI are reported as follows:


Net assets without donor restrictions represent the portion of expendable funds that are
available for any purpose in performing the primary objectives of RMHC-PHI at the
discretion of RMHC-PHI’s management and the Board of Directors (the Board). The
Board designates a portion of these net assets for specific purposes, which makes them
unavailable for use at management’s discretion.



Net assets with donor restrictions represent amounts that are specifically restricted by
donors or grantors for various purposes or for use in future time periods. Net assets with
donor restrictions also represent endowment gifts requiring that the principal be invested
in perpetuity and that only the investment income be expended for purposes designated
by the donor.

Revenue Recognition
Contributions and Grants
RMHC-PHI recognizes all unconditional contributed support in the period in which the
commitment is made. RMHC-PHI reports gifts of cash and other assets as having donor
restrictions if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets.
When a stipulated time restriction ends or purpose of a restriction is accomplished, net assets
with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported in
the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Unconditional
contributed support that is expected to be collected within one year is recorded at its net
realizable value. Unconditional contributed support that is expected to be collected after one
year is recorded at the present value of its estimated future cash flows discounted back to
present value using the appropriate discount rates. Amortization of the discount is recorded as
additional contribution revenue and used in accordance with donor-imposed restrictions, if any,
on the contributed support to which the discount relates.

Revenue Recognition (continued)
Contributions and Grants (continued)
A contribution is conditional if an agreement includes a barrier that must be overcome and either
a right of return of assets transferred or a right of release of a promisor’s obligation to transfer
assets. Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional, that
is, when the barrier(s) in the agreement are overcome.
Donated Goods and Services
Nonfinancial contributions (gifts-in-kind) are recognized as both support and revenue and
expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of activities at the estimated fair value
at the date of donation. In-kind contributions include donated professional services and goods.
Sponsorship Revenue
The portion of Telethon sponsorship revenue that relates to the commensurate value the
sponsor received in return is recognized when the related events are held and performance
obligations are met.
Special Event Revenue – Ticket Sales
The portion of ticket sales that relates to the commensurate value the attendee receives in return
is recognized when the related events are held and performance obligations are met.
Deferred Revenue
Income from event sponsorships received in advance of future special events, which the
resource provider is receiving commensurate value in return or a right of return exists if the event
does not occur, is deferred and recognized in the period to which the sponsorship relate.
Volunteers
Many volunteers, including members of the Board, have made significant contributions of time
in furtherance of RMHC-PHI’s policies and programs. The value of this contributed time does
not meet the criteria for recognition and, therefore, is not reflected in the consolidated statement
of activities.
Functional Allocation of Expenses
The costs of providing the various programs and other activities have been summarized on a
functional basis in the accompanying consolidated statement of functional expenses. Expenses
directly attributed to specific functional areas of RMHC-PHI are reported as expenses of those
functional areas, while shared costs that benefit multiple functional areas have been allocated
among the various functional areas based on estimates determined by management to be
equitable. The shared costs are allocated based on a time study which is done annually as part
of the budgeting process.

Use of Estimates
Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these consolidated financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported revenues and expenses. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Measure of Operations
Income from investments, including realized gains and losses on investment transactions, is
considered to be revenue generated from operations. Unrealized gains or losses recognized
from the change in the fair value of investments are not considered to be from operations until
such time as those gains or losses are realized through investment sale transactions. In
addition, interest income from notes receivable, net assets released for long-term capital
projects, and equipment are not considered to be from operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued guidance (FASB
ASC 326), Current Expected Credit Losses, which significantly changed how entities will
measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that not measured
at fair value through net income. The most significant change in this standard is a shift from the
incurred loss model to the expected loss model. Under the standard, disclosures are required
to provide users of the financial statements with useful information in analyzing an entity’s
exposure to credit risk and the measurement of credit losses. Financial assets held by the
organization that are subject to the guidance in FASB ASC 326 were notes receivable.
RMHC-PHI adopted the standard effective January 1, 2023. The adoption had no impact to the
financial statements.

to claim federal tax credits for making Qualified Equity Investments in a designated Community
Development Entity (CDE). The CDE must use substantially all the of the proceeds to make
Qualified Low-Income Community Investments (QLICIs). The tax credits are claimed over a
seven-year period and equate to 39% of the QLICIs. RMHC-PHI has partnered with an investor,
Chase Community Equity LLC (the Equity Investor), a Delaware limited liability company. The
Equity Investor contributed $7,378,000 in equity to the Chase NMTC PRMH Investment Fund,
LLC (the Fund), a Delaware limited liability company. In conjunction with the equity investment,
RMH (the leverage lender) made a loan of $15,076,200 to the Fund. In turn, the Fund made
equity investments in four CDEs which provided eight loans to PRMH, Inc. totaling $21,525,000.
The loans were made to PRMH, Inc., which is considered a qualified active low-income
community business. The QLICI loans have a seven-year compliance period during which no
principal can be repaid.
The loan provided by RMH to the Fund bears interest at 1% and matures on June 30, 2037.
Interest-only payments are due quarterly commencing on June 15, 2017, and continuing through
December 15, 2024. Commencing on March 15, 2025, the quarterly payments will be composed
of both principal and interest in the amount of $321,138, for an annual total of $1,284,552. For
the year ended December 31, 2023, RMH recognized interest income of $150,762 related to
this note receivable, which is included in interest income from the note receivable in the
accompanying consolidated statement of activities. There was no accrued interest income as
of December 31, 2023.
The loans with each of the CDEs require quarterly interest-only payments at 1.042% per annum
until December 5, 2024, starting on June 5, 2017. Thereafter, annual principal payments of
$1,157,575, plus interest at 1.042% per annum, are due until December 1, 2041, if they are not
accelerated or otherwise retired by the respective lenders at the end of the compliance period.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, PRMH Inc. incurred interest expense of $224,291.

New Markets Tax Credit Financing – Notes Receivable and Payable (continued)
The loans are secured by all of PRMH Inc.’s revenue, inventory, furniture, fixtures, equipment,
other assets, licenses and intangibles, and the deed of trust in PRMH Inc.’s interest in the
property (3925 Chestnut Street Building expansion).
The NMTC financing agreement required PRMH Inc. to establish and fund individual fee and
expense reserve accounts totaling $191,063 during the initial year to pay interest and certain
annual service fees to the respective CDEs over the seven-year NMTC compliance period. Over
the term of the agreement, RMHC-PHI will make the required additional deposits totaling
$363,437 into the accounts. As of December 31, 2023, the balance associated with the reserve
accounts totaled $78,804; it is included in restricted cash in the accompanying consolidated
statement of financial position and will be paid over the compliance period as these fees become
due and payable.
The construction financing for the RMHC-PHI expansion has various financial covenants,
including maintaining certain debt service coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and minimum
tangible net worth. In addition to the financial covenants, RMHC-PHI must comply with certain
NMTC Program requirements during the seven-year compliance period. As of December
31, 2023, RMHC-PHI was not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio required by
the financial covenants of the agreement and respective NMTC Program requirements. RMHCPHI received a waiver from the financial institution related to this requirement.
It is anticipated that, after the seven-year NMTC Program compliance period expires in 2024, in
accordance with a put and call option agreement, the Equity Investor who owns the Fund will
exercise its put option to sell its ownership interest to RMH for a price of $1,000 or RMH will
exercise its call option to buy the Equity Investor’s interest for a pre-determined amount or price
equal to the fair value of the investment, and the Fund will be liquidated and its assets distributed
to RMH. In conjunction with this event, the Equity Investor will be liquidated and its assets
distributed to the Fund. Immediately after the exit transactions are completed, RMH will be the
holder of PRMH, Inc.’s notes payable, and, as such, the notes payable will be eliminated in the
consolidated financial statements, with the notes payable anticipated to be discharged shortly
thereafter.

New Markets Tax Credit Financing – Notes Receivable and Payable (continued)
In October 2020, RMHC-PHI entered into a debt transaction to access additional funds through
the New Markets Tax Credit Program (the NMTC Program). These funds were used for the
equipment related to the expansion of its 3925 Chestnut Street Building Facility. The NMTC
Program permits taxpayers to claim federal tax credits for making Qualified Equity Investments
in a designated Community Development Entity (CDE). The CDE must use substantially all the
of the proceeds to make Qualified Low-Income Community Investments (QLICIs). The tax
credits are claimed over a seven-year period and equate to 39% of the QLICIs. RMHC-PHI has
partnered with an investor, Truist Community Capital, LLC (the 2020 Equity Investor), a
Maryland limited liability company, to utilize the the NMTC Program. The 2020 Equity Investor
contributed $2,000,000 in equity to the RMH Philly Investment Fund, LLC (the 2020 Fund), a
Georgia limited liability company. In conjunction with the equity investment, PRMH Equipment,
Inc., (the leverage lender) made a loan of $1,360,400 to the 2020 Fund. In turn, the 2020 Fund
made equity investments in one CDE which provided two loans to RMH totaling $2,000,000.
The loans were made to RMH, which is considered a qualified active low-i/*ncome community
business. The QLICI loans have a seven-year compliance period during which no principal can
be repaid.
The loan provided by PRMH Equipment, Inc. to the 2020 Fund bears interest at 1.077% and
matures on December 1, 2043. Interest-only payments are due annually commencing on
December 10, 2020, continuing through December 10, 2027. Commencing on December
10, 2028, the annual payments will be composed of both principal and interest in the amount of
$93,017. For the year ended December 31, 2023, PRMH Equipment, Inc. recognized interest
income of $14,652 related to this note receivable, which is included in interest income from the
note receivable in the accompanying consolidated statement of activities. There was no accrued
interest income as of December 31, 2023.
The loans with the CDE require annual interest-only payments at 1.00% per annum until
December 1, 2027, starting on December 1, 2020. Thereafter, annual payments of $101,727,

New Markets Tax Credit Financing – Notes Receivable and Payable (continued)
The NMTC financing agreement required RMH to establish and fund individual fee and expense
reserve accounts totaling $35,000 during 2020 to pay interest and certain annual service fees
to the CDE over the seven-year NMTC compliance period. As of December 31, 2023, the
balance associated with the reserve accounts totaled $19,264; it is included in restricted cash
in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position and will be paid over the
compliance period as these fees become due and payable.
The construction financing for the RMHC-PHI expansion has various NMTC Program
requirements during the seven-year compliance period. The financing for the RMHC-PHI
equipment has a financial covenant to maintain a certain debt service ratio. In addition to the
financial covenant, RMHC-PHI must comply with certain NMTC Program requirements during
the seven-year compliance period. As of December 31, 2023, RMHC-PHI was in compliance
with all of its financial covenants and respective NMTC Program requirements.
It is anticipated that, after the seven-year NMTC Program compliance period expires in
December 2027, in accordance with a put and call option agreement, the 2020 Equity Investor
who owns the 2020 Fund will exercise its put option to sell its ownership interest to RMHC-PHI
for a price of $1,000 or RMHC-PHI will exercise its call option to buy the 2020 Equity Investor’s
interest for a pre-determined amount or price equal to the fair value of the investment, and the
2020 Fund will be liquidated and its assets distributed to RMHC-PHI. In conjunction with this
event, the 2020 Equity Investor will be liquidated and its assets distributed to the 2020 Fund.
Immediately after the exit transactions are completed, PRMH Equipment, Inc. will be the holder
of RMH’s notes payable, and, as such, the notes payable will be eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements, with the notes payable anticipated to be discharged shortly thereafter.
As of December 31, 2023, there were no required principal payments on the notes payable over
the following five years.

Net Assets (continued)
Endowment (continued)
Interpretation of Relevant Law
RMHC-PHI has interpreted relevant law in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Act 141 as requiring
the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted
endowment fund, absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. Pennsylvania law permits,
but does not require, the board of directors to make an election to annually appropriate for
expenditure a selected percentage between 2% and 7% of the fair value of the assets related to
donor-restricted endowment funds averaged over a period of three or more preceding years,
provided the board of directors has determined that such a percentage is consistent with the
long-term preservation of the real value of such assets.
RMHC-PHI approved a 7% spending policy beginning January 1, 2012, which amounted to
$19,326 to be distributed to operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year,
the board suspended two quarters of the annual spend. The realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to permanent endowments are restricted until spent, in accordance with
Pennsylvania law. The endowment fund investment activity is recorded in accordance with the
original gift agreement and RMHC-PHI’s interpretation of the Pennsylvania law.
Funds with Deficiencies
From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor-restricted endowment
funds may fall below the level that the donor requires RMHC-PHI to retain as a fund of perpetual
duration. RMHC-PHI’s policy is to continue to appropriate from such individually-deficient funds
in accordance with its spending policy. As of December 31, 2023, there were no such
deficiencies.
Return Objectives and Risk Parameters
RMHC-PHI has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt
to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment, while
seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include
those assets of donor-restricted funds that the organization must hold in perpetuity. Under this
policy, as approved by the Board of Directors, the endowment assets are invested in funds to
achieve growth in principal value and income over time sufficient to preserve or increase the
purchasing power of the funds, thus protecting the funds against inflation. Actual returns in any
given year may vary.
Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives
To satisfy its long-term return objectives, RMHC-PHI relies on a total return strategy in which
investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and
current yield (interest and dividends). RMHC-PHI targets a diversified asset allocation which is
reviewed as necessary by the Board of Directors.

Availability and Liquidity
RMHC-PHI regularly monitors liquidity required to meet its annual operating needs and other
contractual commitments, while also striving to preserve the principal and return on the
investment of its funds. RMHC-PHI’s financial assets available within one year of the
consolidated statement of financial position date for general expenditures at December
31, 2023, were as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents

Financial Assets Available to Meet
General Expenditures Within One Year

$ 1,985,089

RMHC-PHI has various sources of liquidity at its disposal, including cash and cash equivalents
and investments, which are available for general expenditures, liabilities and other obligations
as they come due. Management is focused on sustaining the financial liquidity of RMHC-PHI
throughout the year. This is done through monitoring and reviewing RMHC-PHI’s cash flow
needs on a regular basis. As a result, management is aware of the cyclical nature of RMHCPHI’s cash flow related to RMHC-PHI’s various funding sources and is therefore able to ensure
that there is cash available to meet current liquidity needs. As part of its liquidity plan, excess
cash is invested in publicly traded investment vehicles, including mutual funds and equity
securities, or to support organizational initiatives. RMHC-PHI has an endowment with a boardrestricted 7% spending rate, and unrestricted investments with a board-restricted 5% spending
rate, resulting in approximately $216,940 of appropriations available within the next 12 months
to fund operating needs. To help manage unanticipated liquidity needs, RMHC-PHI has a
committed line of credit of $2,750,000, which is described in Note 7 above. As of December
31, 2023, $1,025,271 of this line of credit was available to RMHC-PHI to draw upon.

Donated Goods and Services
Donated goods and services are recognized if the services received create or enhance longlived assets or require specialized skills, that are provided by individuals possessing those skills
and would typically need to be purchased if not donated.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, RMHC-PHI received donated professional services
of $227,777 and donated food and program materials of $604,181 totaling $831,958. The
donated professional services are recorded at the estimated fair value based on market rates
for similar services in the United States. The donated food and program materials are recorded
at the estimated fair value based on current market rates for similar food and program materials.
These items are reported as donated goods and services revenue and program expenses in the
statement of activities.
There were no donor-imposed restrictions associated with the donated goods and services.

13.

Commitments, Contingencies and Risks
Concentration of Credit Risk
RMHC-PHI maintains its cash and cash equivalents with certain commercial financial
institutions, which aggregate balances may exceed, at times, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) insured limit of $250,000 per depositor per institution. As of December
31, 2023, RMHC-PHI had approximately $1,260,000 in cash, which exceeded the maximum
limit insured by the FDIC by approximately $856,000. RMHC-PHI monitors the creditworthiness
of these institutions and has not experienced any historical credit losses on its cash and cash
equivalents.
Investment Risk
RMHC-PHI also invests in various investment securities that are exposed to various risks,
including market, interest rate and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain
investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of the
investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.

Retirement Plan
RMHC-PHI maintains a Simplified Employee Pension Plan which covers all full-time employees.
RMHC-PHI contributes 2% of the employee’s annual compensation. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, contributions to the plan amounted to $64,638.

15.

Income Taxes
RMHC-PHI, PRMH, Inc. and PRMH Equipment, Inc. are exempt from the payment of income
taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, these organizations are
taxed only on their net unrelated business income. No provision for income taxes has been
made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2023, as there was no significant net unrelated business income.
RMHC-PHI adopted the authoritative guidance relating to accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes included in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes. These
provisions provide consistent guidance for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an entity’s consolidated financial statements and prescribe a threshold of “more
likely than not” for recognition and derecognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return. RMHC-PHI performed an evaluation of uncertain tax positions for the year ended
December 31, 2023, and determined that there were no matters that would require recognition
in the consolidated financial statements or that may have any effect on RMHC-PHI’s tax-exempt
status. As of December 31, 2023, the statute of limitations remained open with the U.S. federal
jurisdiction or the various states and local jurisdictions in which RMHC-PHI files tax returns;
however, there are currently no examinations pending or in progress. As of December 31, 2023,
RMHC-PHI had no accruals for interest and/or penalties.

16.

Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been classified to current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on net assets as previously reported.

Subsequent Events
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, RMHC-PHI has evaluated events and
transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through April 30, 2024, the date the
consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. There were no subsequent
events other than the loan repayment disclosed in Note 6 that require recognition or disclosure
in the consolidated financial statements.
