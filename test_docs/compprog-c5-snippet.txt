Complete search
Complete search is a general method that can be used to solve almost any
algorithm problem. The idea is to generate all possible solutions to the problem
using brute force, and then select the best solution or count the number of
solutions, depending on the problem.
Complete search is a good technique if there is enough time to go through
all the solutions, because the search is usually easy to implement and it always
gives the correct answer. If complete search is too slow, other techniques, such as
greedy algorithms or dynamic programming, may be needed.
Generating subsets
We first consider the problem of generating all subsets of a set of n elements. For
example, the subsets of {0,1,2} are , {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2} and {0,1,2}.
There are two common methods to generate subsets: we can either perform a
recursive search or exploit the bit representation of integers
